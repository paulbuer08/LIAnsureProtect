# Manual UI Testing Guide — Walk The App As Every Role

> **Living document**, updated in every milestone PR. All names, emails, and companies below are
> **generic test values** — never use real personal information in a test tenant.

> Prerequisite: the app is running and Auth0 is configured — follow
> [Running The App](running-the-app.md) first.

## The test personas (create these once in Auth0)

*User Management → Users → Create User*, then assign the role on each user's **Roles** tab.
Use one shared throwaway password pattern for your tenant (e.g. a password manager entry).

| Persona | Email (generic) | Auth0 role | Plays the part of |
|---|---|---|---|
| Casey Customer | `customer.test@example.com` | `Customer` | An insured company's contact buying cyber cover |
| Blake Broker | `broker.test@example.com` | `Broker` | A broker submitting on behalf of clients |
| Uma Underwriter | `underwriter.test@example.com` | `Underwriter` | The human decision-maker on referred quotes |
| Adrian Admin | `admin.test@example.com` | `Admin` | Superuser — allowed everywhere a business role is |
| Charlie Adjuster | `claims.test@example.com` | `ClaimsAdjuster` | **Live (Phase 3).** Works the claims workbench: assigns claims, requests info/documents, sets reserves, decides (accept/deny/settle), closes — Scenario 5 below |

> **Why one user per role?** Each browser session holds one login. Testing hand-offs
> (customer submits → underwriter reviews → customer responds) is easiest with two browser
> profiles or one normal + one private window, logged in as different personas.

## The map — what exists in the UI today

| Route | Who can use it | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | any signed-in user | Role-aware landing page; only shows the feature cards and menu links the signed-in role can use |
| `/submissions/new` | Customer, Broker, Admin | Create a draft submission |
| `/submissions` | Customer, Broker, Admin | List **your own** submissions (ownership-scoped) |
| `/submissions/:id` | owner | Detail: submit the draft, generate a quote, accept, bind |
| `/underwriting/quote-referrals` | Underwriter, Admin | The underwriting workbench: referral queue, SLA/triage, notes/tasks/timeline, evidence requests, AI review, approve/decline/adjust |
| `/evidence-requests` | Customer, Broker, Admin | Owner-side evidence: see requests, respond with text + up to 5 documents, upload replacements |
| `/notifications` | Customer, Broker, Underwriter, **ClaimsAdjuster**, Admin | Personal + team inbox with unread counts, All/Personal/Team tabs, mark-read; the header shows a compact unread badge |
| `/claims/new` | Customer, Broker, Admin | File a claim (two-step wizard: pick a **bound policy** → incident form) |
| `/claims` · `/claims/:id` | owner | Your claims list + detail (verdict, claimed-amount, adjuster questions, scan-gated documents, timeline) |
| `/claims/adjudication` | **ClaimsAdjuster**, Admin | The adjuster workbench: queue, assign/release, reserves, information requests, accept/deny/close, documents, audit |

There is deliberately **no** admin console yet — `Admin` today means "allowed into every existing
business screen". The **Claims** context is live (Phase 3); `ClaimsAdjuster` now has a full workbench.

The dashboard and top navigation are intentionally role-aware. A customer should not see
underwriting or claims-adjudication links at all; an underwriter should not see customer-only
submission or claims filing actions. Direct URLs are still protected: the React route guard checks
the API-reported roles before mounting the page component, and the API authorization policy remains
the real enforcement point.

## Scenario 1 — The happy path (clean quote, no referral)

**Persona: Casey Customer** (or Blake Broker — same flow, proving brokers act for clients).

1. Log in → **Dashboard** → *Create submission* (`/submissions/new`).
2. Fill with generic values and create:
   - Applicant name: `Jane Applicant`
   - Applicant email: `jane.applicant@example.com`
   - Company name: `Example Widgets Ltd`
3. ✅ Expect: success panel with a **Submission ID** and status **Draft**. Inline validation
   (clear the email field and try) proves Zod + React Hook Form gate bad input **before** any API call.
4. Open `/submissions` → ✅ your submission is listed (and *only* yours — ownership scoping).
5. Open the detail page → **Submit** the submission → ✅ status becomes **Submitted**.
6. **Generate quote** → the rating strategies run. A low-risk answer set produces status
   **Quoted** with premium/limit/retention and subjectivities.
7. **Accept** the quote: enter acceptor name/title (e.g. `Jane Applicant`, `CFO`), tick the
   subjectivities-acknowledged box → ✅ status **Accepted**. (Try accepting *without* the tick —
   expect a clear rejection: attestation is mandatory.)
8. **Bind policy** → ✅ a policy appears with a policy number and bound timestamps.
9. Open `/notifications` → ✅ quote-ready / accepted / policy-bound notifications with unread
   badges; mark one read and see the count drop. (Worker must be running — see the run guide.)

## Scenario 2 — The referral path (the underwriting workbench end-to-end)

This is the richest flow; it exercises the whole Underwriting module.

**Part A — Persona: Casey Customer**
1. Create + submit a new submission, generate a quote — this time the rating answers that imply
   higher risk produce status **Referred** instead of Quoted. (Generate a few submissions if
   needed; the simulated rating refers riskier profiles.)

**Part B — Persona: Uma Underwriter** (second browser profile)
2. Log in → `/underwriting/quote-referrals` → ✅ the referred quote is in the queue with risk
   tier, premium, referral reasons, and an SLA due date.
3. **Assign to me** → ✅ the operation shows you as assigned. *(Known limitation, on the roadmap:
   two underwriters clicking simultaneously is not yet guarded by optimistic concurrency.)*
4. **Triage**: set priority + status + due date → ✅ reflected in the queue row.
5. Add a **work note** and a **follow-up task**, then complete the task → ✅ the **timeline**
   shows every step in order.
6. **Request AI review** → ✅ an advisory packet appears (summary, risk signals, control gaps,
   suggested questions). Note it *cannot* change the quote — that's a structural guarantee.
7. **Request evidence**: category e.g. `MfaPolicy`, title `MFA enforcement evidence`, description,
   due date → ✅ evidence request created.

**Part C — Persona: Casey Customer**
8. `/evidence-requests` → ✅ the request is listed with its due date.
9. **Respond**: respondent `Jane Applicant`, title `CISO`, response text, and attach 1–5 small
   files (PDF/PNG/TXT…, ≤10 MB each). → ✅ documents show **scan status**; clean files become
   downloadable. Try a 6th file or an unsupported type — expect a clear validation error.
10. The local scanner deterministically flags files whose name contains an "infected" marker
    (e.g. `eicar` in the filename) — upload one to see **Rejected**, then use
    **upload replacement** to supersede it. Rejected files stay visible for audit but can never
    be downloaded.

**Part D — Persona: Uma Underwriter**
11. Back in the workbench: ✅ evidence shows as responded; download a clean document; **accept**
    the evidence or record a review decision (`Satisfied` / `Insufficient` / `NeedsClarification`
    with reason). `Insufficient` sends the owner a remediation notification.
12. **Approve / Decline / Adjust** the referral (Adjust changes premium/retention with a reason).
    → ✅ the queue row leaves the pending list; the decision + audit trail are recorded.

**Part E — Persona: Casey Customer**
13. If approved/adjusted: accept the quote and bind, as in Scenario 1.
14. `/notifications` → ✅ the evidence and decision notifications arrived.

## Scenario 3 — Authorization boundaries (prove the fences hold)

1. As **Casey Customer**, browse to `/underwriting/quote-referrals` directly → ✅ blocked before
   the underwriting workbench mounts or calls the referral API. Customers can never underwrite.
2. As **Uma Underwriter**, open `/submissions/new` directly → ✅ blocked before the submission
   form mounts. Underwriters don't create customer business.
3. As **Adrian Admin**, do both → ✅ allowed everywhere (Admin is in every policy).
4. As **Charlie Adjuster**, open `/claims/adjudication` → ✅ allowed; but `/submissions/new` and
   `/underwriting/quote-referrals` → ✅ blocked by the route guard and API policy. Adjusters only
   adjudicate claims.
5. As **Casey Customer**, open `/claims/adjudication` → ✅ blocked (claimants file claims, they don't
   adjudicate); `/claims/new` → ✅ allowed.
6. Log out, hit `http://localhost:5223/api/v1/submissions` with no token (e.g. from PowerShell)
   → ✅ **401** before any business logic runs.

## Scenario 4 — Platform behaviors worth seeing once

| Behavior | How to see it |
|---|---|
| **Idempotency** | Repeat a create-submission POST with the same `Idempotency-Key` header (PowerShell) → same response, no duplicate row; reuse the key with a *different* body → **409** |
| **Rate limiting (M44)** | Flood any endpoint (a loop of ~50+ rapid anonymous POSTs with tightened config, or check `SecurityAndRateLimitingEndpointTests`) → **429** with `Retry-After` |
| **Security headers (M44)** | Browser dev tools → Network → any API response → `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, CSP, etc. |
| **Correlation** | Any API response carries `X-Correlation-ID`; the API logs the same id on every line for that request |
| **Outbox at work** | Stop the Worker, accept a quote → no notification appears; start the Worker → it arrives within ~5s. Nothing was lost — that's the transactional outbox |
| **Health probes** | `/api/v1/health/live` stays Healthy even if you stop Postgres; `/ready` flips to unhealthy |

## Scenario 5 — The claims lifecycle (Phase 3, end to end)

**Prerequisite:** a **bound policy** — do Scenario 1 first so Casey has one. Use two browser
profiles (Casey ↔ Charlie) for the hand-offs.

**Part A — Persona: Casey Customer**
1. Dashboard → **File a claim** (`/claims/new`) → pick your bound policy → incident type
   `RansomwareExtortion`, incident date **within the policy period**, a description, claimed amount
   e.g. `120000` → ✅ claim created, status **Filed**. (Try an incident date *outside* the policy
   period → clear rejection — the file-time policy check.)
2. `/claims` → ✅ your claim is listed (yours only); open the detail → timeline shows "Filed".

**Part B — Persona: Charlie Adjuster** (second profile)
3. `/claims/adjudication` → ✅ the claim is in the queue → **Assign to me** → status **UnderReview**.
   *(The M44.5 concurrency guard applies — a second adjuster assigning gets 409.)*
4. Set a **reserve** (e.g. `150000`) with a reason → ✅ recorded (confidential — Casey never sees it).
5. **Request information** ("Please upload the forensic report") → status **InformationRequested**.

**Part C — Persona: Casey**
6. `/claims/:id` → answer the question inline, and **upload** a document (PDF/PNG) → ✅ shows a scan
   status; a **Clean** file becomes downloadable. (Upload a file whose name contains
   `MALWARE-TEST-SIGNAL` → ✅ **Rejected**, never downloadable — the fail-closed scan gate.)
   Answering returns the claim to **UnderReview**.

**Part D — Persona: Charlie**
7. Download Casey's clean document (authenticated fetch). Then **Accept** with a settlement — try a
   number **above** the policy limit net of retention → ✅ rejected; a number **within** it → ✅
   status **Accepted**, paid amount recorded. (Or **Deny** — requires a reason category + narrative;
   empty → 400.) Then **Close** → ✅ status **Closed**, and any leftover reserve is auto-released
   (visible in reserve history).

**Part E — Notifications**
8. As **Casey**, `/notifications` → ✅ claim assigned/decided messages arrived. As **Charlie**,
   `/notifications` → **Team** tab → ✅ the filing shows in the **claims-operations** team inbox.

## Database spot-checks (optional)

Connect any SQL client to `localhost:5432` (`postgres`/`postgres`, database `liansureprotect`):

```sql
select id, company_name, status from public.submissions order by created_at_utc desc limit 5;
select id, status, premium, referral_reasons from public.quotes order by created_at_utc desc limit 5;
select type, processed_at_utc, provider_message_id, failed_at_utc from public.outbox_messages order by created_at_utc desc limit 10;
select * from underwriting.quote_evidence_requests order by requested_at_utc desc limit 5;
select recipient_user_id, type, read_at_utc from notifications.notification_inbox_entries order by created_at_utc desc limit 10;
```

## When something looks wrong

1. Check the API terminal — errors log with the request's correlation id.
2. Check the Worker terminal — outbox failures log with retry metadata; a poison message shows
   `failed_at_utc` set in `outbox_messages`.
3. Auth issues → the troubleshooting table at the end of [Running The App](running-the-app.md).
4. UI design feedback or bugs you find while walking these scenarios: note the route, persona,
   and correlation id — that triple makes any issue reproducible.
