# Architecture Overview

LIAnsureProtect is designed as a modular, production-style cyber specialty insurance platform.

The core idea is simple:

- PostgreSQL is the system of record, like the official filing cabinet.
- Redis is the fast cache, like a sticky note for data we can rebuild.
- DynamoDB is used later for notification read models, like a fast mailbox for each user.
- S3 is used later for private document storage.
- SNS and SQS are used later for durable event processing.

## High-Level Shape

```text
React Frontend
  |
  | HTTPS
  v
ASP.NET Core Web API
  |
  |-- PostgreSQL: system of record
  |-- Redis: cache
  |-- Local/S3 storage: documents
  |-- Outbox: domain events
  |
Workers

  |-- SQS consumers
  |-- Notification processing
  |-- Audit processing
  |-- AI review processing later
```

## Backend Layers

- Domain: business entities, enums, value objects, and domain rules.
- Application: use cases, DTOs, validators, interfaces, and authorization-friendly business workflows.
- Infrastructure: EF Core, PostgreSQL, Redis, DynamoDB, S3, messaging, and other external services.
- Api: HTTP endpoints, authentication, authorization, middleware, Swagger/OpenAPI, and health checks.
- Workers: background processors and queue consumers.

Application and Infrastructure each expose a dependency-registration extension method. API and Worker startup call those methods so future use cases, repositories, storage services, caches, and messaging adapters can be registered inside their owning layer instead of being scattered through each host.

Current architecture guard tests read the project files and verify the intended project-reference direction:

- Domain references no production project.
- Application references Domain.
- Infrastructure references Application and Domain.
- Api references Application and Infrastructure.
- Worker references Application and Infrastructure.

## API Foundation

The first API baseline uses ASP.NET Core Web API with controllers.

Current foundation:

- OpenAPI document generation for discoverable API contracts.
- ProblemDetails for consistent API error responses.
- Health checks for basic operational status.
- HTTPS redirection for local and production security posture.
- `/api/v1/health` as the first versioned operational endpoint.
- A simple root endpoint that reports the running application name dynamically from the assembly.

Planned API direction:

- Keep public business endpoints under `/api/v1/...` from the beginning.
- Add formal API versioning when the first real business endpoints are introduced or before a breaking API change.
- Generate separate OpenAPI documents later when needed for API versions, public/internal audiences, or frontend/backend API groupings.
- Keep OpenAPI exposed only in development until authentication and role-based access are available.
- Protect API documentation later with authorization, such as Admin or Developer access, before exposing it outside local development.
- Prefer controller-based APIs for business resources, while allowing small `MapGet` endpoints for infrastructure/status endpoints.
- Treat OpenAPI document caching as a later optimization, and avoid public caching for protected/internal API metadata.

## Deployment Tracks

The project supports two production deployment tracks over time:

- ECS Fargate + ALB for the main containerized web API path.
- Lambda + API Gateway for the serverless API path.

ECS Fargate is the stronger first production path for Docker, autoscaling, ALB, WAF, and zero-downtime blue/green deployment. Lambda/API Gateway is added after the API shape is stable.

## Security Defaults

- HTTPS everywhere outside local development.
- Role and policy-based authorization.
- Secrets stored outside source control.
- Private document storage.
- Audit logs for sensitive actions.
- Separate dev, staging, and production environments.

## Production Middleware Direction

Milestone 2 intentionally keeps middleware small. Add production middleware when its supporting feature exists:

- Authentication and authorization policies when user identity is introduced.
- CORS when the React frontend runs from a separate origin.
- Forwarded headers when the API runs behind CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway, or another reverse proxy.
- HSTS when HTTPS hosting is finalized outside local development.
- Rate limiting for public API protection.
- Response compression and safe output caching for suitable non-sensitive responses.
- Request correlation, tracing, and enriched structured logging for production observability.
- Readiness and dependency health checks when PostgreSQL, Redis, queues, storage, and external integrations are added.
